# How to create a React app for github pages

# Step 1

Create app locally.
```
$ npx create-react-app <name_of_app>

```
INstall the gh-pages as a "dev-dependancy" of the app 

```
npm install gh-pages --save-dev

```


# Step 2

Create repository from github. Take note of the name of the repository:

```
http://gitname.github.io/<name_of_repository>
```

# Step 3

Edit package.json to add paramters for predeployment and deployment and address for homepage.

1. Homepage address:

```
//...
"private": true,
"homepage": "http://gitname.github.io/<name_of_repository>"

```

2. Deployment and predeployment parameters
```
"scripts": {
  //...
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

# Step 4
Link remote repository

```
 $ git init
 $ git remote add origin http://gitname.github.io/<name_of_repository>.git

```

# Step 5
After coding your app deploy to github pages

```
$ npm run deploy
```

# Step 6
The above step creates a branch for hosting your website. It does not track your source files. It only tracks the build files. To track source code:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Create a React app and publish it to GitHub Pages"
$ git push origin master
```

# How to add a subdomain to you gh pages

# Step one

Create a CNAME file in the public folder with your subdomain address

```
$ cd public/
$ touch CNAME

```

```
# inside CNAME:
<your-subdomain>.<your-domain>.com
```

# Step two

Update your DNS settings in the console/dashboard of your domain provider. For google domains just add a new custom resource record with the following properties:

# NPM Commmands

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
